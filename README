PROJECT CHARTER

The goal of the matrix project is to create a very simple
matrix math library in C. Initially floating point math will be
used, however fixed point will eventually be supported.

This library should be easy to use, and error tolerant.

Intended Users of this library are engineers operating
in a resource constrained environment.



REQUIREMENTS

1. Provide a matrix structure.
2. Provide an initialized function.
3. Provide a function which creates an identity matrix.
4. Provide a function which creates a zeros matrix.
5. Provide a function which adds two matrices.
6. Provide a function which subtracts two matrices.
7. Provide a function which multiplies (matrix multiply)
8. Provide a function which subtracts two matrices.
9. Halt and print a detailed error message when matrix or mathematical rules are violated.


TESTING
All functions and features shall be validated and verified.
